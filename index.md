We live in a world that runs on software. But who builds that software?

As more of our essential services are digitized, the global engineering skills gap widens and every day more opportunities open for digital workers to build the future. We want you to be able to enjoy these same opportunities.

At Indelible Ideas, we provide education and consulting services to individuals and organisations, to ensure the next generation of engineers have the tools to build a world we all want to live in.
